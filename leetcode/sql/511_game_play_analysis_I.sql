(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to find the first login date for each player.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example:
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
