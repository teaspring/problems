/*
 * count the number of primes less than a non-negative int n. ps: 1 is not prime, 2 is the smallest prime
 *
 * analysis:
 * 1. the normal definition of prime is any n cannot be divided by 2,3,4,...sqrt(n)
 * 2. if i is prime, i-1 and i+1 will never be prime, so we can iterate i by +=2
 * 3. to determine whether i is prime, try to divide i by primes 3, 5, 7, 11... hwo to do it efficiently?
